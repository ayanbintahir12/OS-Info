# What is Package.json?

A package.json is a JSON file that exists at the root of a Javascript/Node project. It holds metadata relevant to the project and it is used for managing the projectâ€™s dependencies, scripts, version and a whole lot more.

# What is Package-lock.json?

Package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
To avoid differences in installed dependencies on different environments and to generate the same results on every environment we should use the package-lock.json file to install dependencies. Package-lock.json tracks the version number of our installed pacakages. If we reinstall packages; this file helps us to install file.

# What is node_modules?

Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application. Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope. Also, each module can be placed in a separate .js file under a separate folder.
